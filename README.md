If you register the passcode for in-person purchase, you can still check the passcode for the item! (Of course others can't!)

## In-person purchase "Face2Pay"
### 1. Owner: enter a passcode when you list the item

### 2. Buyer: check "I'm with the owner!" and enter the passcode that the only seller knows
The "I'm with the owner!" shows up only for the items that the seller allowed the in-person buying
